AIM: WRITE A PROGRAM TO CREATE CHILD PROCESS BY USING FORK SYSTEM CALL.

THEORY: fork() is to create new process by duplicating current calling process, and 
newly created process is known as child processes and current calling process is known as parent process
.so we can say that fork is use to crate a child process of calling process.

PROGRAM:
#include<stdio.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main()
{
	int id;
	printf("this is practical 3 \n");
	id=fork();
	if(id>0)
	{
		printf("this is the parent  section [process id = %d] \n",getpid());
		
	}
	else if(id==0)
	{
		printf("fork creation [chiled id = %d] \n",getppid());
		printf("fork parent process id %d \n",getpid());
		}
		else{
			printf("fork is note created !!!");
		}
		return 0;
}
